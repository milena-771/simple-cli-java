<h3>What is a Command Line Interpreter ?</h3>

**A command line interpreter** (CLI) allows the user to interact with a program using commands in the form of text lines. 
It was frequently used till the 1970’s. However, in modern times many command line interpreters are replaced by **graphical user interfaces** (GUI) and menu-driven interfaces.

Command line interpreters can be more useful than graphical user interfaces in some cases :
- Command line interpreters have a **large range of commands and queries** available for different operations. Also, it is **much faster** to type than to click as is done using graphical user interfaces.
- There are some **systems that don’t have enough resources** to support graphical user interfaces. In those cases, command line interpreters can be used.
- Technically **advanced users also prefer command line interpreters** as compared to graphical user interfaces.
- Commands and instructions can be displayed using braille displays in command line interpreters **for people with visual disabilities.**

<h3>How does a CLI work ?</h3>

A command interpreter is a way to interact with the system with **text-based commands only.** While there are several command-line interpreters, they do not work the same way.
This is because command lines are **based on the syntax of the programming language** that we are using. Thus, a command that works on a CLI on one system may **not work the same way in other systems.** 

<h3>What is a command line ?</h3>

The command line is a blank line and cursor on the screen, allowing the user **to type in instructions for immediate execution.**
Commands can be executed **one at a time by typing the command and pressing Enter.** They can also be executed as a group, in which case the commands are typed into **a "batch" or "script" file.**
The file name is typed on the command line, and pressing Enter causes **each command to be executed in order.**
